# Hi, I'm Aram 👋

I'm a **Full-Stack Developer** based in **Mexico City 🇲🇽**, passionate about building web applications that are both technically solid and thoughtfully designed.

My work focuses on **React, Next.js, Node.js, and NestJS**, where I enjoy architecting scalable systems, modeling clean data structures, and creating intuitive user experiences. I like working across the stack — from backend logic and APIs to frontend interfaces that feel simple and purposeful.

I’m driven by curiosity and continuous learning, always looking to improve my craft and explore better ways to build reliable, maintainable products. Whether it’s a full-scale platform, a real-time application, or a small experimental project, I care deeply about clarity, structure, and user impact.
